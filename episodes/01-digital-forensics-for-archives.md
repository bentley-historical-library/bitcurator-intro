::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Become familiar with digital forensics techniques and their application in cultural heritage and digital curation
- Identify and understand various types of magnetic disk removable media, which might be encountered in collections
- Describe and recommend tools and techniques for extracting content from legacy media, including use of write blockers and creation of disk images
- Understand various types of metadata that can be generated for born-digital content extracted from legacy media
Become familiar with BitCurator and its toolset

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- Why might archivists, librarians, and other cultural heritage workers want to use digital forensics techniques and tools?
- What are some known use cases of digital forensics usage amongst archivists, librarians, or others?
- What is BitCurator? What is the BitCurator environment? Is it the same as "digital forensics"?

## Enter BitCurator Environment (BCE)

## Resources

There are many resources that explain how to use
the BCE and other digital forensics tools.
Given that this lesson focuses on BCE,
most of the resources are geared toward this software
environment, but the list also includes a few more general resources:
